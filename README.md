# Read me

This project is recreation of the signature app with NextJS. The aims are:

1. To keep the implementation as lean as possible ⚡️
2. Include tests 🧪 to increase product confidence 💯
3. Learn 📚 and show off 👀

## For development

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Run `npm run test` for tests

## For production

1. Run `npm run build`. This should build the app in `docs` folder - naming is used in [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) allows. This will be a static export of the app.
2. Commit and push to remote. This should trigger an internal GitHub action to deploy to Pages. See the **Actions** tab.
